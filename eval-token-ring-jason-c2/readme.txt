Configuration

- create 500 workers, named 1 to 500, and each linked to its
  successor;

- worker 500 should be linked back to worker 1, forming an unbroken
  ring;

- initially pass T tokens to workers randomly assigned to a worker;

- each worker passes the token to its neighbouring worker (i.e., the
  worker it is linked to);

- the program halts when all T tokens have been passed, between any
  two workers, N times each.
